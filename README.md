# Digital-Clock
Design: CodeWithSMR

A simple digital clock project that displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The clock updates in real-time and provides a user-friendly way to view the current time.

## Features

- Displays the current time (hours, minutes, seconds).
- Updates automatically every second.
- Simple and clean design.
- Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How It Works

This digital clock uses JavaScript's `setInterval` method to update the time every second. The current time is fetched using the `Date()` object, and then it is formatted and displayed in the browser.

## Project Setup

To run the project, simply download the code and open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structuring the content.
- **CSS** for styling the clock.
- **JavaScript** for handling the time functionality.

## How to Use

1. Download the project or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. The digital clock will start displaying the current time.
